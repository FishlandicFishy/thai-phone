# Welcome to the Thai Phone Project
A useless impractical pseudo-phone OS, a ripoff of a ripoff of an actual phone, a ripoff of another concept, bad designing decisions, all in one place*

## What is the Thai Phone?
The Thai Phone is a web-based pseudo-phone OS, aiming to imitate concepts like the Thai Phone (as in the show *Love Coming Home, Happiness Delivery*) and the infamous iPhone ripoffs, without spending a single dime on its budget.

Where possible, this project is released under CC0.
